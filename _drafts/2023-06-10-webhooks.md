title: Event-Driven Integrations. Using The Webhook API To Create Custom Business Processes

---

This article is a based on the talk of the same name given to the 2023 Preservica User Group in Oxford.

### Introduction to webhooks and APIs

Webhooks are a type of API which allow apps to stay up-to-date with real-time information. Webhooks are also called event-driven APIs and are typically used to provide other applications with real-time data. 

Using webhooks, applications can send you data automatically when certain events are triggered.

This allows to custom business processes to be created based on events within Preservica

### Preservica Webhooks

Webhooks are a new API introduced in Preservica v6.8.  They are based on a publisher-subscriber pattern.

Preservica is the publisher and will send messages to all registered subscribers when certain events are triggered within the system.

The key difference between webhooks and traditional APIs is Who triggers the process. With traditional APIs the trigger is an event outside of Preservica and with webhooks the trigger is an event inside Preservica.

Webhooks work best when you need to take some action when something new has happened within Preservica.


Preservica has provided two events as part of the first webhook release with v6.8
