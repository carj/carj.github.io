title: Event-Driven Integrations. Using The Webhook API To Create Custom Business Processes

---

This article is a based on the talk of the same name given to the 2023 Preservica User Group in Oxford.

### Introduction to webhooks and APIs

Webhooks are a type of API which allow apps to stay up-to-date with real-time information. Webhooks are 
also called event-driven APIs and are typically used to provide other applications with real-time data.

Using webhooks, applications can send you data automatically to 3rd party systems when certain events are triggered with
Preservica. Unlike the traditional process of “polling” in which a client asks the server if anything has changed, 
web hooks automatically send out information to subscribed systems when certain events have happened.

This allows to custom business processes to be created based on events within Preservica.

### Preservica Webhooks

Webhooks are a new API introduced in Preservica v6.8.  They are based on a publisher-subscriber pattern.

Preservica is the publisher and will send messages to all registered subscribers when certain events are 
triggered within the system.

The key difference between webhooks and traditional APIs is Who triggers the process. 
With traditional APIs the trigger is an event outside Preservica and with webhooks the trigger is an 
event inside Preservica. The result is that you do not have to continually poll Preservica to get new information. 


Webhooks work best when you need to take some action when something new has happened within Preservica.

Preservica has provided two events as part of the first webhook release with Preservica v6.8

 
 * Ingesting Assets

 * Moving Assets


### Webhook Documentation

The webhook API is documented in the official Preservica [Swagger pages](https://demo.preservica.com/api/webhook/documentation.html) and the 3rd party [pyPreservica](https://pypreservica.readthedocs.io/en/latest/webhooks.html) Python SDK

 ![Swagger](/public/images/swagg1.png)

The following examples will use the Preservica SDK [pyPreservica](https://pypreservica.readthedocs.io/en/latest/webhooks.html)

### Subscribing

Before a system can receive notifications from Preservica, it must subscribe to a notification trigger.

When creating a new subscription service, you need to generate a shared secret key and pass it as an argument to the 
subscribe method. This is then used by the subscriber to verify the messages sent by Preservica (publisher) are genuine 
(to prevent spoofing attacks). 

Using the PyPreservica SDK to create a new subscription to Ingested events, you pass the address of a web service which
can receive HTTP POST requests. This could be a web server or some API gateway service. If you use a web server it 
must provide a publicly accessible endpoint. If your running a local server for testing purposes it will need to use some 
kind of ingress service to make your local server accessible.

Along with the URL, you need to pass an argument which specifies which type of even you are interested in and the shared
secret. The INDEXED event is triggered at the end of the ingest process after the content has been full text indexed and
thumbnails are available.

The Preservica Webhook API requires the user to have at least the repository manager role, ```ROLE_SDB_MANAGER_USER```

```python
from pyPreservica import WebHooksAPI

webhook = WebHooksAPI()

subscription = webhook.subscribe("http://my-webhook.com:8080", TriggerType.INDEXED, "my secret key!")

```
During the subscription process, Preservica will send a challenge response message to the specified 
endpoint URL to verify that it exists. 

Preservica will make a POST request to the URL with a challengeCode query parameter. 
The server must respond with the expected challenge response or the subscription will fail. 
The challenge response must take the form of a simple json document:


```python
{
  "challengeCode": "challengeCode",
  "challengeResponse": "hexHmac256Response"
}

```

where hexHmac256Response is a hex hmac256 of the challengeCode using the secret as the hmac key. Therefore,
the server process will need a copy of the secret key to verify requests.


### Receiving Events

To receive web hook notifications pyPreservica has provided a reference web server implementation which provides 
support for the negotiation of the challenge request handshake during the subscription request and 
verification of each webhook event request.

To implement the web server, extend the base class WebHookHandler and implement a 
single method do_WORK() this method is called every time Preservica calls the web hook. 
This method is therefore where any processing takes place. 

```python

class MyWebhook(WebHookHandler):
  def do_WORK(json):
    # Do something useful
   

```

The handler can then be used to create a web server, the web server should be run from the same directory as a 
pyPreservica credential.properties file containing the shared secret which was used earlier to create 
the web hook subscription.

The WebHookHandler extends the BaseHTTPRequestHandler base class and will provide the handshake and 
message verification automatically. Only verified messages are actioned.  This class is part of the pyPreservica SDK.

```python
import json
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler
from urllib.parse import urlparse, parse_qs
import hmac
from pyPreservica.common import *

class WebHookHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    """
    A sample web hook web server which provides handshake verification
    The shared secret key is passed in via the HTTPServer

    Extend the class and implement do_WORK() method
    The JSON document is passed into do_WORK()

    """

    def hmac(self, key, message):
        return hmac.new(key=bytes(key, 'latin-1'), msg=bytes(message, 'latin-1'), digestmod=hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()

    def do_POST(self):
        result = urlparse(self.path)
        q = parse_qs(result.query)
        if 'challengeCode' in q:
            code = q['challengeCode'][0]
            signature = self.hmac(self.server.secret_key, code)
            response = f'{{ "challengeCode": "{code}",     "challengeResponse": "{signature}" }}'
            self.send_response(200)
            self.send_header("Content-type", "application/json")
            self.end_headers()
            self.wfile.write(bytes(response.encode('utf-8')))
            self.log_message(f"Handshake Completed. {response.encode('utf-8')}")
        else:
            verif_sig = self.headers.get("Preservica-Signature", None)
            if "chunked" in self.headers.get("Transfer-Encoding", "") and (verif_sig is not None):
                payload = ""
                while True:
                    line = self.rfile.readline().strip()
                    chunk_length = int(line, 16)
                    if chunk_length != 0:
                        chunk = self.rfile.read(chunk_length)
                        payload = payload + chunk.decode("utf-8")
                    self.rfile.readline()
                    if chunk_length == 0:
                        verify_body = f"preservica-webhook-auth{payload}"
                        signature = self.hmac(self.server.secret_key, verify_body)
                        if signature == verif_sig:
                            self.log_message("Signature Verified. Doing Work...")
                            self.log_message(payload)
                            self.send_response(200)
                            self.end_headers()
                            self.do_WORK(json.loads(payload))
                        break


```

The following is an example Python web server which can respond to Preservica web hooks.
In this example the web hook server downloads the thumbnail image for every ingested asset.

```python
from http.server import HTTPServer
from sys import argv
from pyPreservica import *

BIND_HOST = '0.0.0.0'
PORT = 8080


class MyWebHook(WebHookHandler):
    def do_WORK(self, json_payload):
        for reference in list(json_payload['events']):
            ref = reference['entityRef']
            asset = self.server.client.asset(ref)
            self.server.client.thumbnail(asset, f"{ref}.jpg")


if __name__ == '__main__':

    config = configparser.ConfigParser(interpolation=configparser.Interpolation())
    config.read('credentials.properties', encoding='utf-8')
    secret_key = config['credentials']['secret.key']

    if len(argv) > 1:
        arg = argv[1].split(':')
        BIND_HOST = arg[0]
        PORT = int(arg[1])

    print(f'Listening on http://{BIND_HOST}:{PORT}\n')

    httpd = HTTPServer((BIND_HOST, PORT), MyWebHook)
    httpd.secret_key = secret_key
    httpd.client = EntityAPI()
    httpd.serve_forever()

```
The web server can be then be started from the command line using.


```commandline
  $ python3 server.py 0.0.0.0:8000
```

### Use Case:  Custom Notifications

This use case shows how we can chain webhooks together to allow 3rd party systems to communicate with each other.
We are going to use Microsoft Teams as the 3rd party system as Teams provides incoming webhook functionality.
We can connect an outgoing Preservica webhook to an incoming teams webhook to transfer information into Teams.

 ![UseCase](/public/images/usecase1.PNG)

The end result is that every Asset ingested into Preservica will automatically 
send a notification into a Microsoft Teams channel. 

We will use the python library pymsteams to help create the 
[messages](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/connectors-using?tabs=cURL)

Our web hook server now looks like:


```python
from http.server import HTTPServer
from sys import argv
from pyPreservica import *
import pymsteams

BIND_HOST = '0.0.0.0'
PORT = 8080

class MyWebHook(WebHookHandler):
    
    def teams_message(self, asset):
        myTeamsMessage = pymsteams.connectorcard(self.server.teams_url)
        myTeamsMessage.color("red")
        # create the section
        myMessageSection = pymsteams.cardsection()
        myTeamsMessage.title("Preservica has ingested a new asset")

        # Section Title
        myMessageSection.title(asset.title)
        # Facts are key value pairs displayed in a list.
        myMessageSection.addFact("Asset Title", asset.title)
        myMessageSection.addFact("Asset Description", asset.description)

        for bitstream in self.server.client.bitstreams_for_asset(asset):
            myMessageSection.addFact("BitStream Name",  bitstream.filename)
            myMessageSection.addFact("BitStream Length", f"{bitstream.length} Bytes")

        # Section Text
        myMessageSection.text("Asset Metadata")
        # Section Images
        myMessageSection.addImage(f"https://ua.access.preservica.com/download/thumbnail/IO_{asset.reference}")
        # Add your section to the connector card object before sending
        myTeamsMessage.addSection(myMessageSection)
        myTeamsMessage.addLinkButton("View the Asset in UA", f"https://ua.access.preservica.com/uncategorized/IO_{asset.reference}")
        myTeamsMessage.summary("Test Message")
         
        myTeamsMessage.send()
    
    
    def do_WORK(self, json_payload):
        for reference in list(json_payload['events']):
            ref = reference['entityRef']
            asset = self.server.client.asset(ref)
            self.teams_message(asset)

if __name__ == '__main__':

    config = configparser.ConfigParser(interpolation=configparser.Interpolation())
    config.read('credentials.properties', encoding='utf-8')
    secret_key = config['credentials']['secret.key']

    if len(argv) > 1:
        arg = argv[1].split(':')
        BIND_HOST = arg[0]
        PORT = int(arg[1])

    print(f'Listening on http://{BIND_HOST}:{PORT}\n')

    httpd = HTTPServer((BIND_HOST, PORT), MyWebHook)
    httpd.secret_key = secret_key
    httpd.client = EntityAPI()
    httpd.serve_forever()

```
Every ingest now creates the following message in teams

### Event Driven Serverless Architecture 

In the examples above, a web server is used to receive the web hook notifications. This can turn out to be
inefficient as the web server needs to be running on a server even when no notifications are being sent.

In turns out that webhooks are especially well suited to modern serverless architecture 
such as Amazon Lambda and Azure Functions. Running a dedicated web server is inefficient and unnecessary.

AWS Lambda and Azure Functions are code fragments which are triggered to run from external events 
such as web hooks. This is a simple and cost-effective approach to processing events.

* No application server provisioning and maintenance required 
* Web server infrastructure is provided for you through the API Gateway
* Only pay for the milliseconds used
* Highly Scalable

AWS has a dedicated set of infrastructure based on the [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) service 
which allows public API endpoints to be created. These API endpoints act as the "front door" for the 
webhook applications managing traffic management, CORS support, authorization and access control, 
throttling, and monitoring etc. For the Preservica webhook use case the API gateway only needs to accept HTTP
POST requests.

When the API gateway receives a webhook notification it will pass the message payload from Preservica to the 
AWS Lambda function which will carry out the appropriate action.

Lambda support multiple languages such as Java, Go, PowerShell, Node.js, C#, Python, and Ruby code, so you 
can build your applications in the language of your choice.
