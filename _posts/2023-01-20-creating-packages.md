title: Creating Preservica Packages using the Python SDK
---


[pyPreservica](https://pypreservica.readthedocs.io/) is a 3rd party open source (Software Development Kit) SDK for the Preservica API. 
It provides a range of services to allow users to access the full range of Preservica APIs from within simple Python scripts.
One of the most useful parts of pyPreservica is the ability to create a wide range of submission packages from 
Python scripts programmatically without requiring the user to hand create XML documents.
